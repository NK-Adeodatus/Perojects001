                Is MovieHub or 123Movies Better to watch series and movies?
                Both MovieHub and 123movies have been among the most popular sites for movie lovers for years. Although 123movies was shut down in 2018, its copies and fake sites are still mushrooming everywhere. 123movies was no doubt a safe site but we should not trust any site that has 123movies in its domain name. Most 123movies sites are fake and filled with malicious ads, which might cause you serious troubles such as data loss, identity theft, information leakage, corrupted networks, etc. If you have not managed to find the real 123movies, it is only wise to stick with ad-free, risk-free sites only.
